As my final year project, I conducted an investigation into the effectiveness of virtual reality.
I used Unreal Engine 4, Oculus Rift DK2, and Kinect for Windows V2 to create a range of experiments that measured a user’s biometrics using an EEG sensor (NeuroSky’s MindWave).

The repository comes in 2 parts; the Unreal project that features the experiments and combines Oculus Rift and Kinect, then the experiment recorder and processor that records the EEG readings and automatically crunches them into graphs and tables using automatic excel document generation for easy intepretation.
